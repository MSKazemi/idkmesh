# Changelog

Notable changes are summarized here; this is not an exhaustive commit log.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). IDKMesh is
pre-1.0 research software and does not yet follow semantic versioning: contracts under
`schemas/` carry their own explicit versions (for example `work-unit-v0.2`), and those
versions, not the release tag, are what downstream code should depend on.

This file starts at the first public release. Earlier changes remain in git history
and the release notes for that tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/demo.py`, a narrated contract tour using the repository's real validators
  and committed synthetic fixtures: three positive checks and four rejection checks.
  It does not run an agent or prove live independence, accepted work, or merge authority.
- `tests/test_demo.py`, including regression checks that unexpected process/programming
  failures cannot count as expected contract rejections. Temporary fixtures keep the
  tests from modifying shared repository evidence.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, including both `tests/` and `interop/tests/` in
  the editor's pytest discovery and an automatic fixture demo on attach. Hosted
  environment availability and cost are not guaranteed by this configuration.
- `CITATION.cff` and this changelog.
- `actions/gate-audit/`, the composite Action integrated through PR 395, with an
  exact-head self-test checking report-byte identity and the authority disclaimer.

### Changed

- README introduces the synthetic contract demo with virtual-environment setup and
  links the existing contributor invitation. Installation time is environment-dependent.
- Support and issue-template entry points route open-ended questions to Discussions.
- The newer CONTRIBUTING.md instructions from PRs 405 and 408 are preserved rather
  than replaced by another setup sequence.

## [research-preview-2026-08-29] - 2026-08-29

First public research-preview snapshot, published as a prerelease. See the
[release notes](https://github.com/MSKazemi/idkmesh/releases/tag/research-preview-2026-08-29)
for the Work Unit, ResultManifest, EvaluatorPlan and VerificationResult foundations,
repository/branch observatories, bounded recommendation layers, synthetic experiments,
and CI security surfaces.

This is research software, not a production-ready distributed agent platform. The
release notes preserve its evidence and independent-review limitations.
